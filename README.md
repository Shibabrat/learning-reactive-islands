## Machine learning for phase space structures in reaction dynamics


Collection of MATLAB, Python scripts, and notebooks to generate training data
and support vector classifier models for learning reactive islands in a model
Hamiltonian. The model Hamiltonian is the two degrees of freedom
H{\'e}non-Heiles system which is an open non-linear dynamical system and
considered as a benchmark for method development and verification.
